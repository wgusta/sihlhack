# PROMPT: The "Lex Sihlicon" Strategy & Dual-License Implementation

**Context:**
The "SihlHack" project promotes "Active Energy Nodes" (servers as heaters). There is a critical risk of the "Cobra Effect": bad actors using this narrative to install inefficient e-waste hardware solely to harvest "waste heat" subsidies or bypass resistive heating bans, creating "Zombie Servers" (Energy Vampires) that destabilize the grid.

**Objective:**
You are to act as a **Legal Engineer and System Architect**. Your goal is to implement the "Lex Sihlicon" framework to prevent this perverse incentive while preserving the open-source spirit for legitimate builders.

**The Strategy: Dual-License Model**

You must enforce a strict separation between the physical hardware (which should be free) and the control logic (which must be responsible).

1.  **The Body (Hardware) -> Open & Permissive**
    *   **License:** CERN-OHL-P or MIT.
    *   **Philosophy:** "Anyone can build the machine."
    *   **Scope:** Thermal architecture, CAD files, schematics, BOMs.
    *   **Why:** To maximize adoption and innovation in thermal recovery hardware.

2.  **The Conscience (Software/Grid-OS) -> Civic & Constrained**
    *   **License:** "Sihl Valley Common-Good License" (SVG-L).
    *   **Philosophy:** "You cannot remove the machine's conscience."
    *   **Scope:** The Scheduler, Orchestrator, Negotiation Logic, and Grid-Interface code.

**Key License Clauses to Enforce:**

*   **The "Thermodynamic Truth" Clause:**
    > "The Software may not be modified to obfuscate, falsify, or artificially inflate the reporting of computational work or thermal output. 'Dummy Loops' (NO-OP cycles) designed solely to generate heat without economic or scientific value are a violation of this license."

*   **The "Grid Obedience" Clause:**
    > "Any deployment of this Software controlling significant load must maintain an active, uninhibited interface for Grid Frequency containment. Modifying the Software to ignore grid curtailment signals (e.g., during frequency deviations) terminates the license immediately."

*   **The "Anti-Vampire" Clause:**
    > "This Software may not be used on hardware with a Computational Efficiency Rating lower than [X] FLOPS/Watt, unless said hardware is designated as 'Historical Heritage' and limited to educational use."

**Instructions for Content Generation:**

When updating the website (`CONCEPT.md`, Landing Pages, Terms):
1.  **Be Explicit:** Do not hide this in fine print. Frame it as a "Feature" ("The Conscience"), not a restriction.
2.  **Use Narrative:** Contrast "Silicon Valley Scale" (Growth at all costs) with "Sihl Valley Precision" (Responsible Engineering).
3.  **Explain the "Why":** We do not build heaters that think; we build thinkers that heat. We fight the "Cobra Effect."

**Tone:**
*   **Direct & Sovereign:** Unapologetic about protecting the grid.
*   **Forensic:** Grounded in thermodynamic reality, not marketing fluff.
*   **Empowering:** "Good engineers welcome these rules; only grifters fear them."
