# The Sihlhack Manifesto

## What We Believe

We believe in building infrastructure that serves communities for decades, not products optimized for quarterly exits. We believe in precision over speed, sovereignty over scale, and ownership over extraction. We believe that the best innovations come from those who will live with the consequences of their choices.

Silicon Valley taught us to move fast and break things. We choose a different path: build carefully, make it last, own what you create.

This is the Sihlvalley way.

## Core Principles

### 1. Build to Last, Not to Exit

Infrastructure that heats homes, powers neighborhoods, and stabilizes grids cannot be built with exit strategies in mind. The Sihlicon Hub—combining Battery, Compute, Heat, and Resilience—is designed to serve Swiss communities for decades, not to attract venture capital.

**What this means:** When you build the thermal recovery system, you're not prototyping for a pitch deck. You're engineering a system that will sit in someone's basement, converting server waste heat into home heating. The safety interlocks you design protect real families. The grid integration you code manages actual electricity flows.

**The contrast:** Silicon Valley optimizes for growth metrics and user acquisition. We optimize for energy efficiency, thermal recovery, and grid stability. One model seeks scale at all costs. The other seeks precision that serves.

### 2. Own What You Build

Every line of code you write at sihlhack is yours. Apache 2.0 means you can fork it, compete with it, commercialize it. We encourage you to start a company tomorrow using the code you write here. There are no hidden agendas, no ecosystem seeding, no corporate ownership of participant work.

**What this means:** The Grid-OS scheduler you build? Yours. The thermal path evaluation you document? Yours. The safety case you develop? Yours. You can take it to a Lokale Elektrizitätsgemeinschaft (LEG) and deploy it commercially. You can fork it and compete with other participants. You can build on it for years.

**The contrast:** Traditional hackathons extract value from participants for corporate sponsors. Corporate hackathons own your work, your ideas, your time. We invert this: participants fund the event, participants decide the challenges, participants own the outcomes.

### 3. Transparency by Default

All finances are public in real time. Every centime collected, every expense incurred, every prize distributed is visible to anyone who looks. There are no hidden costs, no undisclosed sponsors, no opaque decision-making processes.

**What this means:** When you pay CHF 150 to register, you see exactly how that money flows: 70% to the prize pool, 30% to operations. You see the break-even calculations. You see if the event will proceed or trigger automatic refunds. You see who contributes historical data (companies, not sponsors). You see the judging criteria before you start building.

**The contrast:** Corporate hackathons operate behind closed doors. Sponsor influence is hidden. Judging criteria shift. Financial arrangements are opaque. We reject this model entirely. If you can't see how decisions are made and money flows, you can't trust the process.

### 4. Precision Over Scale

Switzerland's advantage is not scale—it's precision. We build small, precise, coordinated systems. The Sihlicon Hub serves a neighborhood, not a continent. This is not a limitation; it's a design philosophy.

**What this means:** Instead of building datacenters that heat rivers, we build servers that heat houses. Instead of optimizing for global user acquisition, we optimize for local energy sovereignty. Instead of one-size-fits-all solutions, we offer three thermal paths and let teams choose: Immersion Cooling, Water Loop, or Heat Pump Integration. Precision means the right solution for the right context.

**The contrast:** Silicon Valley's "move fast, break things" philosophy optimizes for speed and scale. Break things quickly, fix them later, scale globally. We optimize for precision: build it right the first time, make it last, serve the local community. One model creates technical debt and externalities. The other creates sustainable infrastructure.

### 5. Energy Sovereignty, Not Cloud Dependency

Data stays in Switzerland. Compute runs on Swiss solar. Heat warms Swiss buildings. This is sovereignty, not convenience. Decentralized infrastructure means communities control their energy, their data, their resilience.

**What this means:** The Sihlicon Hub is an Active Energy Node that operates independently. When the grid fails, it powers the neighborhood. When solar peaks, it stores energy in batteries and runs deferred compute jobs. When servers generate heat, that heat warms homes. No cloud dependency, no data leaving Switzerland, no external control of critical infrastructure.

**The contrast:** Silicon Valley builds cloud-dependent systems that centralize control and data. We build decentralized systems that return control to communities. One model creates dependencies. The other creates sovereignty.

### 6. Participant Agency: You Fund, You Decide, You Build

The inversion is simple: participants pay, participants decide, participants execute. Companies contribute historical data only—never money, never influence. The challenges you work on are chosen by participants. The thermal paths you evaluate are your choice. The code you write is your ownership.

**What this means:** You pay CHF 150 from your own wallet because you believe in the mission, not because your employer reimburses it. You vote on project proposals. You choose which challenge to tackle: Demo-Kit, Hardware Safety, or Grid-OS. You evaluate three thermal paths and decide which fits your team's expertise. You own every decision because you fund every decision.

**The contrast:** Traditional hackathons: companies pay, companies set challenges, participants execute company agendas. Sihlhack: participants pay, participants set direction, participants own outcomes. One model creates alignment with corporate interests. The other creates alignment with participant values.

### 7. Open Architecture, Not Prescribed Solutions

We provide constraints, not solutions. Three thermal paths exist—Immersion, Water Loop, Heat Pump—but no path is prescribed. Teams evaluate trade-offs and choose. This is engineering, not kit assembly.

**What this means:** The thermal challenge is real: how do you extract 99% of waste heat from a server? Immersion cooling captures 99% but requires complex handling. Water loops capture 60-70% but use standard parts. Heat pumps output 70°C+ but add complexity and cost. There is no "right" answer—only trade-offs that teams must evaluate.

**The contrast:** Corporate hackathons often provide kits with prescribed solutions. "Use this API, build this feature, follow this architecture." We provide constraints and let teams find the path. One model optimizes for predictable outcomes. The other optimizes for genuine innovation.

## The Sihlvalley Way

Silicon Valley builds datacenters that heat rivers. We build servers that heat houses.

Silicon Valley optimizes for advertising revenue. We optimize for thermal efficiency.

Silicon Valley scales globally. We build precisely, locally.

This is not opposition for its own sake. It is a recognition that different problems require different approaches. When the problem is energy sovereignty, decentralized infrastructure, and community resilience, the solution is not "move fast and break things." The solution is "build carefully, make it last, own what you create."

The Sihlvalley way is Swiss precision applied to energy infrastructure. Small, precise, coordinated. Not scale at all costs, but precision that serves.

## A Call to Those Who Share These Values

If you believe that infrastructure should serve communities for decades, not quarterly reports, join us.

If you believe that participants should own what they build, not corporations, join us.

If you believe that transparency builds trust, not opacity, join us.

If you believe that precision and sovereignty matter more than scale and dependency, join us.

If you believe that energy infrastructure should be decentralized, open-source, and community-controlled, join us.

**Du baust es.** You build it. You own it. You decide.

This is sihlhack. This is the Sihlvalley way.
