# SIHLHACK Concept

## The Sihl Valley Industrial Heritage

The Sihl Valley (Sihltal) was the cradle of Zurich's industrialization. From textile mills to machine factories, companies kept meticulous records: ledgers, photographs, technical drawings, employee records, production data. Much of this data sits in archives, undigitalized and unexplored.

### What Lies Hidden

- Production optimization strategies from an era of resource scarcity
- Organizational structures that enabled rapid scaling
- Technical innovations that were ahead of their time
- Business models abandoned due to technological limitations
- Social structures and worker welfare programs

### Historical Context

The Sihl river powered factories throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. Companies like:
- Textile manufacturers
- Machine tool factories
- Paper mills
- Chemical plants
- Precision instrument makers

All kept detailed records that capture not just business data, but the evolution of Swiss industrial thinking.

## The Participant-Oriented Model

### Traditional Hackathon Model

```
Companies pay → Companies set challenges → Participants compete → Company prizes
```

Problems with this model:
- Corporate agenda drives innovation direction
- Participants work on company problems, not their own ideas
- Prize money comes with strings attached
- Solutions often serve company interests, not broader value

### SihlHack Model (Inverted)

```
Participants pay → Participants propose → Participants vote → Collective prizes
```

Benefits:
- Removes corporate agenda from innovation
- Attracts intrinsically motivated participants
- Creates genuine ownership over outcomes
- Ensures alignment between effort and reward
- Democratizes the innovation process

### How It Works

1. **Registration**: Participants pay a registration fee (e.g., 150 CHF)
2. **Fund Pool**: 70% goes to prize pool, 30% to operations
3. **Proposal Phase**: Anyone can propose project ideas
4. **Voting**: Registered participants vote on proposals
5. **Hackathon**: Top-voted projects are pursued
6. **Judging**: Peer and expert evaluation
7. **Prizes**: Distributed from collective pool

### Transparency Commitment

- All collected funds visible in real-time
- Expense breakdown public
- Transaction ledger accessible
- Automatic refunds if event cancelled

## The AI Digitalization Pipeline

### Before the Hackathon

1. **Company Outreach**: Contact Sihl Valley companies with historical archives
2. **Data Collection**: Companies provide raw materials (photos, ledgers, documents)
3. **Initial Processing**: Basic scanning and cataloging
4. **Preview Generation**: Create browsable catalog for participants

### During Registration Period

5. **OCR Processing**: Extract text from handwritten and typed documents
6. **Image Recognition**: Identify objects, people, machinery in photographs
7. **Structuring**: Convert extracted data to queryable formats
8. **Pattern Discovery**: ML algorithms find initial connections

### During Hackathon

9. **Participant Access**: Full dataset available to registered participants
10. **Real-time Processing**: Additional AI processing on demand
11. **Insight Generation**: Participants build on processed data
12. **Cross-referencing**: Connect findings across multiple company archives

- Computation: Cloud credits provided (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Data access: Secure local network + cloud backup
- Catering: Covered by operating budget
- Documentation: Professional photography/video

## Why This Works

### Economic Alignment

Participants who pay are more committed. They have skin in the game. They will propose better projects and work harder because success means return on their investment.

### Innovation Quality

Corporate hackathons often produce solutions that are "good enough" for the sponsoring company. Participant-driven hackathons produce solutions that participants genuinely believe in.

### Historical Relevance

The Sihl Valley archives contain real business decisions, real trade-offs, real innovations. These are not theoretical case studies but actual industrial history waiting to be rediscovered.

### AI Timing

Current AI capabilities (OCR, image recognition, LLMs) make it possible to process historical documents at scale for the first time. This is the right moment to attempt this.
