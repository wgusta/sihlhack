# sihlhack Strategy

## The Non-Negotiable Vision

sihlhack inverts the traditional hackathon model. This inversion is the entire point. Any change that moves us back toward traditional corporate hackathon dynamics dilutes the core value proposition and must be rejected.

### The Model

```
Traditional:  Companies pay → Companies decide → Participants execute
sihlhack:     Participants pay → Participants decide → Participants execute
```

### The Sihlicon Hub: Active Energy Node

The hackathon builds the **Sihlicon Hub** - an Active Energy Node combining:
- **Battery**: Time-shift solar energy, provide UPS/resilience
- **Compute**: Deferred compute jobs, batch processing
- **Heat**: Thermal recovery (Immersion, Water Loop, or Heat Pump)
- **Resilience**: Load shedding, community backup

**Key Principle**: The thermal path is NOT prescribed. Teams evaluate three options and choose. This is the engineering challenge, not a kit assembly.

### Core Principles

1. **Participants fund the event** through registration fees (CHF 150)
2. **Participants choose their challenge** (Demo-Kit, Hardware Safety, or Grid-OS)
3. **Participants choose their thermal path** (Immersion, Water, or Heat Pump)
4. **Participants own their code** (Apache 2.0 - fork, compete, commercialize)
5. **Open-source tools only** (Apache-2.0/MIT for commercial LEG compatibility)
6. **All finances are public** in real time
7. **Automatic refunds** if minimum threshold is not met

## What We Will NOT Do

These are not open for discussion. They represent the slow creep back to corporate hackathon norms.

### No "Support Partners" with Perks

Companies do not pay for speaking slots, brand placement, or influence. If they want publicity, they contribute historical data. That is the deal.

### No Employer-Focused Optimization

We do not optimize for corporate expense accounts. Participants pay from their own wallets because they believe in the mission. This creates alignment. Catering to HR reimbursement flows attracts a different participant profile.

### No "Data Partner ROI Reports"

Companies get their archives digitized. They get the PR value of participating in heritage preservation. They do not get post-event insight reports, follow-up consulting, or "deliverables." The deliverable is: your archives are now digital.

### No Governance Layers

The model is simple: participants decide on projects, organizers handle logistics and compliance. Adding governance committees, advisory boards, or stakeholder councils introduces politics and dilutes participant ownership.

### No Appeal Ratings for Stakeholders

We do not optimize for "stakeholder appeal" scores. We build something good. If companies want to participate on our terms, they participate. If they want traditional sponsorship perks, they find a traditional hackathon.

## What We Must Do (Swiss Compliance)

These are legal and operational necessities, not vision elements.

### Legal Entity

Establish a proper Swiss legal entity before collecting real payments. Options:
- **Verein** (association): simpler, lower costs, member-based
- **GmbH**: more formal, clearer liability protection

Decision required before launch.

### Data Protection (DSG)

Switzerland's new Federal Act on Data Protection (nFADP/DSG) applies. Requirements:
- Privacy policy in German with purpose, retention, processors, cross-border transfers
- Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with all processors (Vercel, Stripe, Resend)
- Process for access, deletion, and export requests
- Breach notification plan

### Historical Data and Copyright

Archival materials may still be protected. For each Data Partner:
- Explicit written permission to digitize and display to participants
- Clear access level designation (hackathon-only, public-after, restricted)
- Redaction requirements for personal data in historical records
- Rights statement: company warrants it has authority to share

### Payment Regulations

Stripe Connect with manual payouts is the mechanism. Communication must:
- Avoid "escrow" language (we are not a licensed escrow provider)
- Use plain language: "Funds held until confirmation; refund if conditions fail"
- Publish how Stripe fees, chargebacks, and refunds affect displayed numbers
- Respect Stripe's 90-day payout constraint in event timeline

### VAT (MWST)

Registration fees may trigger VAT obligations depending on:
- Legal entity structure
- Classification of fees (event ticket vs. membership vs. service)
- Total annual revenue

Engage a Swiss accountant before launch.

### Event Liability

- Event liability insurance (Haftpflicht)
- Clear house rules and code of conduct with enforcement process
- Health and safety plan for venue
- Photo/video consent policy for attendees

### Terms and Policies Required

Before collecting payments:
- `/terms` participation terms (cancellation, refunds, liability, conduct, prizes)
- `/privacy` DSG-compliant privacy policy with processor list
- `/code-of-conduct` with enforcement process

## Messaging Strategy

### Participant Voice (Du/Ihr)

All messaging uses "du" (singular) or "ihr" (plural) to emphasize participant agency:
- "Du baust es" (not "wir bauen")
- "Ihr entscheidet" (not "wir entscheiden")
- "Dein Code. Deine Entscheidung." (not "unser Code")

This creates a "community underdog" vibe where participants solve problems, not organizers.

### Sihlvalley vs Silicon Valley

Cheeky, confident attitude:
- "Silicon Valley baut Rechenzentren, die Flüsse erhitzen. Wir bauen Server, die Häuser heizen."
- "Silicon Valley optimiert Werbung. Wir optimieren Wärmeflüsse."
- "Der kleine Sihlvalley will mit Silicon Valley konkurrieren."

This positions Switzerland as a precision player, not a scale player.

### Open Architecture Messaging

- **Not**: "We use immersion cooling"
- **Instead**: "Drei thermische Pfade. Euer Team entscheidet."

- **Not**: "Here's the solution"
- **Instead**: "Ihr bekommt Constraints, ihr findet den Weg."

### Trust Through Ownership

- Apache 2.0 means you can fork, compete, commercialize
- "Du kannst morgen eine Firma gründen, die mit dem Code konkurriert, den du hier schreibst. Wir ermutigen das."
- No hidden agendas, no ecosystem seeding

### Full Sentences, Bullet Points

- Use full sentences for complex concepts
- Use bullet points for simple, glanceable information
- Avoid em/en dashes in prose (use colons, commas, periods)

## Governance Principles

### Transparency Model

**Public by default, private when legally required:**
- Public: totals, allocations, participant count, deadlines, event status
- Private: transaction-level logs (privacy), participant identities, company-restricted datasets

**Aggregation for privacy:**
- Publish totals and counts, not individual transactions
- Round amounts to prevent re-identification
- Delay publication if needed to protect privacy

### Configuration Freeze

Event configuration (thresholds, deadlines, fee split) can be changed until a published cutoff date. After that:
- No changes except for safety or legal reasons
- Any emergency changes require public explanation with timestamp

### Decision Authority

| Decision Type | Who Decides |
|---------------|-------------|
| Project direction | Participants (via voting) |
| Prize criteria | Published rubric |
| Safety and venue | Organizers |
| Data access tiers | Data-contributing companies |
| Compliance matters | Organizers (with legal input) |

## Company Relationship (Data Partners)

### What They Provide

- Historical materials: photographs, ledgers, documents, blueprints
- Written permission to digitize and share with participants
- Basic metadata and context about materials

### What They Receive

- Free digitization of provided materials
- OCR outputs where feasible
- PR and heritage preservation positioning
- Nothing else

### What They Do Not Receive

- Challenge-setting rights
- Speaking slots
- Brand placement
- Post-event reports
- Influence over voting or judging
- Any form of sponsorship recognition

### Agreement Structure

Simple Data Partner Agreement:
- Company warrants rights to share materials
- Specifies access level per dataset
- Acknowledges no control over participant projects
- Grants organizers right to process and display to participants

## Financial Transparency

### Displayed Metrics

- Total collected (CHF)
- Participant count
- Prize pool (70%)
- Operations pool (30%)
- Days until deadline
- Event status (monitoring / confirmed / cancelled)

### Not Displayed

- Individual transaction amounts
- Participant names or emails
- Company-specific contribution counts

### Allocation Split

Fixed at 70/30:
- 70% to prize pool (distributed to winning projects)
- 30% to operations (venue, catering, compute, infrastructure)

The 70/30 split is published before registration opens and does not change.

## Judging and Prizes

### Judging Criteria

Publish rubric before hackathon. Criteria must be:
- Objective enough to apply consistently
- Skill-based (not random)
- Disclosed to participants in advance

### Judge Selection

- No judge evaluates a team affiliated with their employer
- Conflicts of interest disclosed before judging
- Mix of technical and domain expertise

### Prize Distribution

Distributed via Stripe payouts after event. Timeline:
- Winners announced at event
- Verification period (3 business days)
- Payout initiated
- Funds received (3-5 business days)

## Timeline Constraints

### Stripe 90-Day Limit

Funds cannot be held indefinitely. Event must occur within 90 days of registration opening.

### Venue Alignment

Refund deadline must align with venue cancellation window. Do not pay venue costs that cannot be recovered if event is cancelled.

### Recommended Timeline

```
T-8 weeks: Registration opens, fund tracker live
T-6 weeks: Data submission deadline for companies
T-4 weeks: Data catalog published, proposals open
T-2 weeks: Voting closes, top projects announced
T-1 week:  Registration deadline, refund decision
T-0:       Hackathon (48 hours)
T+3 days:  Prize verification
T+1 week:  Prize distribution
```

## What This Document Is

This is the authoritative strategy document for sihlhack. It supersedes external proposals and well-intentioned suggestions that would dilute the core model.

When evaluating changes or additions, ask: "Does this move us closer to a traditional corporate hackathon?" If yes, reject it.

The power of sihlhack is its simplicity and its inversion. Protect both.
